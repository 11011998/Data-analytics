## 📂 About Me

I'm a passionate data analyst with hands-on experience in government data operations and civil engineering analytics. I love turning messy data into meaningful stories using tools like Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau.

Currently upskilling through job simulations from Tata, Deloitte, and Microsoft, and building a portfolio of real-world projects.
